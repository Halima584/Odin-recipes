    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The vanilla cake recipe is great for all occasions and easy to 
        make. It's the best cake I have ever made. It's not too bland, and it's 
        not too sweet.</p>
    <p>Slice the cooled cake through the middle to take two layers and 
        frost as desired.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>cooking spray</li>
         <li>2&frac23; cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
         <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
         <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
         <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
         <li>2 pinches salt</li>
         <li>3 eggs</li>
         <li>&frac34; cup milk</li>
         <li>&frac34; cup vegetable oil</li>
       </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
       <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F (175&deg;C). 
            Grease a 9-inch cake tin with cooking spray and line
            with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, vanilla extract, and salt
            together in a large bowl. Add eggs, milk and vegetable oil; 
            mix by hand or beat with an electric mixer on low speed until smooth.
            Add more flour if batter is too runny. Pour into the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of
            the cakes comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. 
            Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert cake carefully onto a cooling rack.
            Let cool completely.</li>
       </ol>
