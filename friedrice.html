    <h2>Description</h2>
       <p>Fried rice is a Nigerian delicacy, very simple yet delicious recipe.</p>
       <p>It relies on a ton of fresh vegetables, beef liver and little bit of oil
        for crisping up. The added beef liver gives the fried rice a very nice rich
        but subtle taste and this is why it is one of the most popular choices in 
        Nigeria.</p>
       <p>Though you can also use Shrimp or any protein you'd like. If you would love
        to make vegan fried rice, you can omit the Beef liver or shrimps entirely!</p> 
       </p>
